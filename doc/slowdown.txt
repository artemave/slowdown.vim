*SlowDown.vim* slows down vim input

USAGE

No need to do anything. It just works as long as plugin installed. You can't toggle it either (it is a feature).

You can configure how slow it can get. In .vimrc:

    let g:slow_down_max_delay_ms = 200

Actual delay on every keypress is a random value between 100 and `g:slow_down_max_delay_ms` ms.
